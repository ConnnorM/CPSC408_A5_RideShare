# CPSC408_A5_RideShare
MySSQL RideShare Lab
NOTES:
- Everything is working and fully functional as far as my testing has shown

THINGS TO DO:
- make a schema that's written out
- make sure that we have 3rd form normalization (should be good since we made an ER diagram)
- maybe print column titles to the user? so instead of just seeing d1 they would see driverID printed above where it says d1?
