# CPSC408_A5_RideShare
MySSQL RideShare Lab
NOTES:
- the rateDriver function now works and is much cleaner to read
- I tested everything and found 2 bugs (see below), otherwise I think it's pretty good

THINGS TO FIX:
- if you're a new driver/rider and you view rides, it just prints empty space
- if you're a rider with no rides who tries to rate the most recent driver, it crashes
- we could add some newlines to what we print to the screen to make it look a bit cleaner

THINGS TO DO:
- make a schema that's written out
- make sure that we have 3rd form normalization (should be good since we made an ER diagram)
- maybe print column titles to the user? so instead of just seeing d1 they would see driverID printed above where it says d1?
