# CPSC408_A5_RideShare
MySSQL RideShare Lab
THINGS TO FIX:
-if you're a new driver/rider and you view rides, it just prints empty space
-if you're a rider with no rides who tries to rate the most recent driver, it crashes
-we could add some newlines to what we print to the screen to make it look a bit cleaner

THINGS TO DO:
-make a schema that's written out
-make sure that we have 3rd form normalization (should be good since we made an ER diagram)
-maybe print column titles to the user? so instead of just seeing d1 they would see driverID printed above where it says d1?
