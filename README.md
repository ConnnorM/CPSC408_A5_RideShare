MySSQL RideShare Lab

-everything works except for rateDriver
-if the original ride info is correct, it works
-if the original ride info is wrong, you can input new info
    -if you put in new info, it still updates the driver from the original, incorrect query instead of the
    driver of the actual ride you want to edit
    -if you input new info, we need to print the ride's details and ask if that's the correct ride
        -if not, we need to loop through the whole selecting a new ride process
